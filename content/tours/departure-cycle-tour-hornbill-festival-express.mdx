A cycling expedition that takes you to the Hornbill Festival in Kohima. Often cited as “festival of all festivals”, The Hornbill Festival is a grand celebration that is brought to life each December in Nagaland. The festival is a powerful representation of the Naga culture through splendid traditional music, dance and cultural performances, undoubtedly the grandest cultural extravaganza of the country.

We start cycling from Shillong the capital of hilly Meghalaya. Over the 6 riding days we cover three states and five distinct hill ranges.  Starting from the Khasi hills, we make our way into the Jaintia hills, followed by the North Cachar hill tract and Karbi hills till we finally enter the Naga hills. Every day is completely different from the previous, be it riding conditions, terrain or the environment. 

With a cycling distance of ~390 Km in 6 riding days, this is a fun moderate level route. 6 cycling days, 2 days to soak in the Hornbill Festival and the vicinity of Kohima.
