Starting from the lush plains of the Lohit river we make our way up the Mishmi hills along the mighty Dibang river, these two are the easternmost tributaries of the mighty Brahmaputra. This ride takes you to the far eastern flank of the Himalayas, where the mighty Himalayan chain ends (or starts). Lying in the eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the Mishmi hills is an untouched wonderland of unending swathes of pristine nature. 
Enroute you will meet the Therevada tribes that inhabit the plains and the animist tribes that live in the hills, while all along you will be treated to unsurpassed vistas of the high Himalayas and the mighty Brahmaputra Valley. With a cycling distance of ~360 Km in 6 riding days, this is a fairly tough route. However, the sights and experiences more than make up for all the challenge's.
