Aeyo Valley Trail, the easternmost trek of the Himalayas. This 11 day tour takes you to the pristine Dibang Valley of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh. A land of unending forests, beautiful river valleys and hills that lead to a ring of jagged mountains at the eastern periphery of India. Home to the Idu Mishmi people, this is where the Himalayas end...or starts.

This unique trek takes you right to the edge of the Himalayas. Our destination is a high altitude lake complex perched deep in the mountains, a stoneâ€™s throw away from the Chinese frontier. This is a pristine route far from any known tourist maps. This is the land of the Mishmi Takin, the Red Panda and the highest ever recorded Bengal tigers.
